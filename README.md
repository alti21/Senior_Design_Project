# Senior_Design_Project
Management App for the SJSU International House
I worked in a group of 4 student engineers to build a web application for the international house at San Jose State University. 
The app was designed for international house staff so they could perform their work on the app instead of on paper, increasing 
their productivity and keeping them organized. My main role was working on some of the UI (front-end developer).
While working on this project, While working on this project I experienced working in a professional environment: as a group we 
had to work to meet the customerâ€™s requirements, and we were also managed by a project adviser.
